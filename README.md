# Monad problem

When trying to verify using the official instructions, the process fails.
- Openzeppelin Upgradeable Verification: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/api-hardhat-upgrades#verify
- Monad verification guide: https://docs.monad.xyz/guides/verify-smart-contract/hardhat

Neither of the below works:
```
hre.run('verify:verify', ...)

npx hardhat verify 0x4bc819117D6bDcc1696C25b7aa8660b53CEc555C --network monad-testnet
```

Fails with this:
```
DeployedBytecodeMismatchError: The address provided as argument contains a contract, but its bytecode doesn't match any of your local contracts.
```

I modified the sample provided from the contract withard (https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/wizard) from "^0.8.22" to exact version "0.8.20". Otherwise was getting:
```
Sourcify:
The contract you want to verify was compiled with solidity 0.8.20, but your configured compiler version is: 0.8.22.
```





# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a contract generated by [OpenZeppelin Wizard](https://wizard.openzeppelin.com/), a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

## Installing dependencies

```
npm install
```

## Testing the contract

```
npm test
```

## Deploying the contract

You can target any network from your Hardhat config using:

```
npx hardhat run --network <network-name> scripts/deploy.ts
```
